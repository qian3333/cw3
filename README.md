***How to use***
Run the app in an Android Jetpack Compose project to see a randomly generated contacts list grouped by the first letter with sticky headers; scroll down past ~10 items to reveal a floating "scroll to top" button that smoothly returns you to the top.

***Explaination***
This code uses Jetpack Compose to implement a contacts list grouped by the first letter of the name with sticky group headers. It supports randomly generating sample contacts, smooth scrolling back to the top (shows a floating "scroll to top" button when scrolled far), accessibility semantics, and previewing the UI.

***ai reflection***
I used AI tools to produce some examples related to scrollable components and state, and asked how to implement scrolling up when there are more than 10 contacts. I also had the AI generate random contacts and phone numbers.
