***How to use***
Call the MainScaffold() composable from Activityâ€™s setContent. It sets up a Material3 scaffold with a top app bar, bottom navigation (Home/Settings/Profile), a floating action button that shows a Snackbar, and central content that updates when tap navigation items.

**Explaination***
This code quickly builds a basic UI using Jetpack Compose and Material3 that includes a top app bar, bottom navigation (Home/Settings/Profile), a floating action button (FAB), and centered content; tapping bottom items switches the displayed content, and tapping the FAB shows a Snackbar.

***AI reflection***
I asked the AI for some usage instructions about Material3, including how to use the top bar and introductions to some other features.
